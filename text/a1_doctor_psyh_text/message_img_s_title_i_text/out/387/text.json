Investigators found that 38.7% of participants reported persistent pain, and 27.8% reported intermittent pain. (“Persistent pain” was defined as being bothered by pain in the last month in two consecutive annual interviews and “intermittent” pain was defined as bothersome pain in one interview only.)   Over the subsequent 7 years, participants with persistent pain were more likely to experience declines in physical function (64% persistent pain, 59% intermittent pain, 57% no bothersome pain) and well-being (48% persistent pain, 45% intermittent pain, 44% no bothersome pain), but were not more likely to experience cognitive decline (25% persistent pain, 24% intermittent pain, 23% no bothersome pain). “The findings from this study point to the importance of access to effective treatment for persistent pain in older adults and the need for additional research in chronic pain to optimize quality of life,” said lead author Christine Ritchie, MD, MSPH, of Massachusetts General Hospital. We sought to determine the population-level associations between persistent pain and subsequent changes in physical function, cognitive function, and well-being, outcomes important to older adults. We used data from National Health Aging Trends Study (NHATS) of community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries age 65+ from 2011 to 2019. We defined “persistent pain” as being bothered by pain in the last month in both the 2011and 2012 interviews and “intermittent” pain including those reporting bothersome pain in one interview only. We used competing risks regression to estimate the association between persistent pain and the development of clinically meaningful declines in physical function, cognitive function, and well-being, adjusting for age, sex, race, education, and marital status at baseline. Of the 5589 eligible NHATS participants, 38.7% reported persistent pain and 27.8% reported intermittent pain. Over one-third described pain in five or more sites. Over the subsequent 7 years, participants with persistent pain were more likely to experience declines in physical function (64% persistent pain, 59% intermittent pain, 57% no bothersome pain; aHR 1.14, 95% CI 1.05–1.23) and well-being (48% persistent pain, 45% intermittent pain, 44% no bothersome pain; aHR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01–1.21), but were not more likely to experience cognitive decline (25% persistent pain, 24% intermittent pain, 23% no bothersome pain; aHR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90–1.16). Persistent pain is common in older adults and occurs in multiple body sites. Persistent pain contributes to meaningful declines in physical function and well-being over 7 years and warrants proactive interventions to mitigate pain."
