        "How the bacterium can move out of the intestine and to other organs has remained largely unexplored. However, researchers have observed that two different populations of the same species of bacterium exist, Dr. Morales said. One population develops traits that allow it to pass through the intestinal barrier acquiring an advantageous resistance to antimicrobials, while the other stays put.",
        "The next step for the researchers is to evaluate additional in vivo models to confirm whether the molecular pathways uncovered in the current study are needed for the bacterium to exit the intestine. \"We are also interested in identifying pharmacological approaches that can target these specific pathways with the goal of one day helping patients better fight infections by this gut microbe,\" Dr. Morales said."
