    "title": "Antibiotic-resistant microbes in the gut make C. difficile more infectious",
    "summary": "Researchers have found that Enterococcus -- an antibiotic-resistant, opportunistic pathogen -- works together with C. difficile, reshaping and enhancing the metabolic environment in the gut so that C. difficile can thrive.\n",
    "first": "Clostridioides difficile, often referred to as C. difficile or C. diff, is a bacterium that causes severe intestinal illness and, as its name suggests, can be difficult to study and treat. Approximately 1 in 6 patients infected with C. difficile will be reinfected within two months. Yet scientists have not figured out why C. difficileinfection is more difficult to treat in some patients versus others. The human gut is filled with trillions of microbes, and these microbes influence the virulence of various pathogens, but until now, scientists had little understanding of how C. difficile cooperates with the rich collection of microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract.",
