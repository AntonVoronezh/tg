    "first": "Researchers from the Organoid group (formerly the Clevers group) have improved human small intestinal organoids -- miniature versions of the small intestine. This will help them to better study the functioning of the small intestine during health and disease. Specifically, the researchers managed to develop organoids that contain mature Paneth cells, which were not present in the previous human small intestinal organoids. The results of the study were published on the 23rd of August in Cell Stem Cell. ",

        "The development of organoids has meant a lot for research on the functioning of human organs and tissues. This has to do with the fact that the mini-organs give a good representation of human biology. However, some of the currently available human organoids, such as the small intestinal organoids, do not yet resemble the original organ fully. Researchers from the Organoid group therefore developed a new, optimized version of the miniature small intestines: organoids that include all cell types of the human small intestine.",

        "Now that optimized human small intestinal organoids are available, researchers can expand on what they study. For instance, researchers can use the organoids to make mutations in the DNA of the cells. In this way, they can determine how mutations -- occurring in diseases such as IBD -- affect the function of the small intestine."
