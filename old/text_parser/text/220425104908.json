    "summary": "Researchers have demonstrated that a gut parasite suppresses inflammation and improves the health of the gastrointestinal system.\n",
    "first": "The human gut -- or gastrointestinal system -- where food is broken down into nutrients for the body, is an ecosystem that harbours thousands of bacteria species, whose interactions determine its health and susceptibility to diseases. While some microorganisms are harmful, many are beneficial and help keep the human body in good health. It is largely accepted that the more diverse the species of bacteria, the greater capacity the gut has in regulating its health and combating diseases.",

        "\"The common view of bacteria is that they are either good or bad. However, interactions between bacteria and the human body evolve over time, and the key is finding a balance that can cultivate a healthy environment for the gut,\" said Dr Lukasz Wojciech, a co-author of the study."
