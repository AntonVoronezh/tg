        "Enterococci are bacteria that can, on their own, cause dangerous infections that are difficult to treat. For example, they can cause meningitis, urinary tract infections (which can be very serious in the elderly) and the painful gastrointestinal disease diverticulitis, as well as other illnesses. But the researchers found that the threat they pose does not end there.",
        "\"Biology is a data-rich science and the power of computational models to use these data is only in its infancy,\" Papin said. \" We're excited about the innumerable opportunities to use data science and computer modeling to drive biological discovery.\""
